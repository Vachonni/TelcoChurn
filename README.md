# Description of the task

A Telco company has a churn challenge. 

The manager from marketing intends to launch an attractive offer to get a discount. The marketing manager knows that there is a limited number of customers he/she should reach so he/she is not sure how many to contact or what the discount should be. The marketing manager does not have a great understanding of data science and is in the process of evaluating various solutions. Right now, he/she is looking at a solution that uses some considerations about revenue and the number of products in the household, based on his business estimates, to form some segments to communicate to.

Your job is to convince the marketing manager to use your data science solution to find the right number of customers to communicate to. Also, to select the specific customers to send messages to - hereby creating the most value for this Telco.
